# Multiple Disorder Prediction App

Welcome to the Multiple Disorder Prediction app! This application predicts the likelihood of obesity and diabetes in a person based on various inputs. It utilizes machine learning models, pipelines, and column transformers to efficiently handle data and provide predictions.

## Overview

This project incorporates machine learning models trained to predict the probability of obesity and diabetes in individuals. The models are developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment using pipelines, column transformers, and exported as pickle files for easy deployment.

## Technology Stack

- **Model Development:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Descision Tree Classifier, implemented using pipelines and column transformers
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud Services
